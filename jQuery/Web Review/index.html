            <p>The World Wide Web is abbreviated as WWW. The World Wide Web is defined as "all the resources and users
                on the Internet who use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol" (HTTP).</p>
            <p>The World Wide Web Consortium, which Web creator Tim Berners-Lee helped form, provides a larger

            <p>The World Wide Web is a collection of network-accessible material that represents human knowledge.</p>
            <p>Simply described, the World Wide Web is a method of transmitting information between computers connected
                to the Internet, resulting in a massive collection of interactive multimedia resources.</p>

            <p>While working at CERN in 1989, British scientist Tim Berners-Lee devised the World Wide Web (WWWW). The
                Web was created to address the demand for automated information sharing among scientists at universities
                and research organizations around the world.</p>
            <p>CERN is not a solitary laboratory, but rather the hub of an international community of approximately 17
                000 scientists from over 100 nations. The scientists normally work at universities and government
                laboratories in their home countries, although spending some time at CERN. As a result, reliable
                communication mechanisms are required.</p>
            <p>The WWW's primary concept was to combine computer, data network, and hypertext technologies into a
                powerful and user-friendly global information system.</p>

            <h3>What are the common bottlenecks for a website not scaling up?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    When a website isn't scaling up, there are two main bottlenecks: DDoS and bandwidth. DDoS
                    (Distributed Denial of Service) is a type of attack that slows down a server by sending harmful
                    answers through infected computers.
                    Due to the bandwidth constraint imposed by the server or the network, when a significant number of
                    people visit the website, the server will slow down.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>How to address these common bottlenecks?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    To address these issues, consider the following options:


                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adapt suitable technology to protect against future DDoS attacks, such as Cloudfare.</li>
                    <li>Update both the server's operating system and applications.</li>
                    <li>To accommodate large users, increase the bandwidth.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>What could be possible causes if a http response is generated quickly but it takes time for a http
                request to be received (by the web server)?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The origin of the server could be the cause of this issue; for example, you may be from the
                    Philippines, yet you are accessing the site from Antarctica. Consider how quick the internet is, but
                    how long it takes for the server to respond to your request.
                </p>

            </div>
            <h3>What would be the fixes for these possible causes?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Try to host the website on a server that is as close to the user as possible.
