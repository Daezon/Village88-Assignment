        <h1>An Introduction to JavaScript</h1>

        <p>
          Let's see what's so special about JavaScript, what we can achieve with
          it, and what other technologies play well with it.
        </p>

        <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>

        <p>
          <a href="" class="Java">JavaScript</a> was initially create to "make
          web pages alive".
        </p>

        <p>
          The programs in this language are called
          <a href="" class="Java">script.</a> They can be written right in a web
          page's HTML and run
        </p>

        <p>automatically as the page loads.</p>

        <p>
          Script are provided and executed as plain text. They don't need
          specail preparation or compilation to run.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language
          called <a href="">Java</a>
        </p>

        <div class="wordbox1">
          <p>
            When JavaScript was created, it initailly had another name:
            "LiveScript". But Java was very popular at that
          </p>

          <p>
            time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a
            "younger brother" of Java would help.
          </p>

          <p>
            But as if evolved, JaveScript became a fully independent language
            with its own specification called
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="">ECMAScript</a>, and now it has no relation to Java at
            all.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on
          other server, or actually on any device that has a
        </p>

        <p>special program called <a href="">the JavaScript engine.</a></p>

        <div class="wordbox2">
          <h2>How do engines work?</h2>

          <p>Engines are complicated. But the basics are easy.</p>

          <p class="phases">
            1. The engine (embedded if it's a browser) reads ("prases") the
            script.
          </p>
          <p class="phases">
            2. Then it converts ("compiles") the script to the machine language.
          </p>
          <p class="phases">3. And then the machine code run, pretty fast.</p>

          <p>
            The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It
            even watches the compiled script as it
          </p>
          <p>
            runs, analyzes the data that flows through it, and further optimizes
            the machine code based on that
          </p>
